  <h2>Release 1.12.0</h2>
<h3>
New features:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The categories, their names and their colors are now fully user configurable. You can create up to 63 different categories now and assign them. 
  For this, the database schema has to be updated so databases opened with version 1.12.0 no longer can be opened with 1.11.x - the system does make a backup before migrating though.
</li>
<li>Even if this sounds like a simple change, the number of changes required was much bigger than expected. So please treat this version with a bit of caution and get back to me should you encounter any issues.</li>
<li>Also, for some strange build reasons there is no version for macOS yet. Please use the 1.11.2 version until I can make a working Mac build.</li>
</ul>
