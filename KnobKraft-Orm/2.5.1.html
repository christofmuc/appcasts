<p>This release brings a whole load of new adaptations, some of which are brand new and some have been around but not part of the
official release for a while. If you encounter any problems, just let me know!</p>
<h2>Synths:</h2>
<ul>
<li>#274 <strong>Roland Juno-DS</strong> - adaptation created by @mslinn, a thousand thanks for developing this from scratch and contributing it!</li>
<li>#394 <strong>Moog Voyager</strong> - nicely working adaptation for the classic. Thanks to Thanks to @troach242 for the nudge and test!</li>
<li>#395 <strong>Akai AX80</strong> - beta version of the adaptation. Feedback please by owners! Thanks to O.S.R.C. on YT for the nudge! </li>

<li>#397 <strong>Elektron Analog Rytm</strong> -- beta version. Thanks to @RadekPilich for the request!</li>
<li><strong>Elektron Digitone</strong> -- alpha version, as it looked very similar to the Analog Rytm. This needs more work, owners please provide feedback so we can complete it.</li>
<li>#244 <strong>Waldorf Pulse</strong> alpha, this needs some more work and investigation. Thanks to @markusschlosser and chatGPT for the groundwork.</li>
<li><strong>Sequential Trigon-6</strong> beta, this should be relatively straightforward as the Sequential synths all behave well.</li>
<li><strong>Oberheim Teo-5</strong> beta, this is a newer synth and probably close to the Take-5 in terms of MIDI.</li>
<li><strong>Oberheim OB-X8</strong> beta, this is now based on the generic Sequential module. Fingers crossed this works!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug fixes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed #388: Switching the database would not clear the right hand side panels for current patch, bank, and patch history.</li>
