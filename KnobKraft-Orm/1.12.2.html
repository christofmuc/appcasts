  <h2>Release 1.12.2</h2>

  <h3>
    New features:
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added export of patches into Standard MIDI Files as an option (#83)</li>
    <li>Added a function to copy the current patch into the clipboard in a format suited for the CF sysex recorder (#87), somewhat of an experimental feature.</li>
    <li>Added a new Routing mode checkbox to the Macro Setup page: "Forward Electra One". This is a quick and dirty mode
      which opens the USB control port of
      the Electra One and forwards all messages from it to the currently selected synth (not yet into the other
      direction). This can be used to quickly test the Electra One
      without the need of more than one USB cable, no further MIDI connections required.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    Bugfixes:
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixing crashes resulting from trying to send sysex messages larger than 64 KByte as they might happen with
      Electra One presets. The Crashes are fixed, but expect further problems when trying to send large presets directly
      to the Electra One. We're working on it.</li>
    <li>More stability fixes for crashes happening when you supply invalid Python adaptation code.</li>
    <li>Don't print Sysex messages longer than 1000 bytes into the MIDI log view - this would make the application
      sluggish/unresponsive.</li>
    <li>Don't print additional newlines when an adaptation calls print()</li>
    <li>Fix random crashes happening when switching the synth, caused by non-thread safe access of the new category list from the database.</li>
    <li>The Electra One adaptation got some more stability fixes given that some app store presets are invalid JSON and could easily crash the Orm.</li>
  </ul>
