  <h2>Release 1.15.1</h2>

  <p>Minor bugfixes, bringing back the Yamaha reface DX that was lost in the 1.15.0, and starting to build Ubuntu releases in addition to Windows and macOS.

  </p>

  <h3>New synths</h3>

  Thanks to @nezetic, we have two new modules!

  <ul>
    <li>We now have an adaptation for the Novation Ultranova.</li>
    <li>Also, the new Zoom MS adaptation supports the Zoom Multistomp padels of the Zoom MS Series (50G/60B/70CDR)!</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The refaceDX synth was gone - put it back in. This is not an adaptation (there is one to test the 1.15.0 multi-message feature) but still C++ code.</li>
<li>Improve first time startup layout - gone is the old portrait mode layout meant for my Android Tablet.</li>
</ul>
