  <h2>KnobKraft 2.0.1 (Beta) - lot's of bug fixes </h2>

  <p>Thanks to everybody for feedback on the first beta release of KnobKraft 2.0.0, this is the second beta release with a couple of important bug fixes:
  </p>

  <h3>Bug fixes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Fix filtering of the log so you can select e.g. Debug or Warning level only</li>
    <li>Removed the colouring of the log as the algorithm was not stable and seemed to slow things down too much (#214).</li>
    <li>Fixed program change send mode for higher banks not being addressed correctly</li>
    <li>Speedup of building the list of all imports for a synth (#211)</li>
    <li>Speedup of querying for duplicate names in the database (#212) - thanks to @chatgpt !</li>
    <li>Fixed sort order for duplicate name search as well (#212)</li>
    <li>Fixed log entry not showing patch name anymore (#210)</li>
    <li>Fixed adaptation overview table in documentation (#208)</li>
  </ul>

<h3>New features</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Initial try of adding a new second main window (open via View... menu) that can be used to switch patches from a second (potentially low-res) touchscreen. I am using this to try out new UI that can deal with much less pixels than the original UI.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Synth updates</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Much improved John Bowen Solaris adaptation, thanks to @conversy !</li>
    <li>Waldorf Blofeld now uses device ID instead of (wrong) MIDI channel, thanks to @bboc for pointing that out!</li>
</ul>
