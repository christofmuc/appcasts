  <h2>Release 1.11.2</h2>
<h3>
New features:
</h3>
<ul>
<li> Instead of always creating a ZIP file with edit buffer dumps on pressing "Export into sysex files", you will now get a new Dialog asking you for a) the type of dumps that should be written - program dumps if the synth supports it, or edit buffer dumps - and b) whether to create one file per patch, a ZIP file with one file per patch, or one single large sysex file with all messages appended to each other. </li>
</ul>
