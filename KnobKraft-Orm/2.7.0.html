<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>#463 Trying to make the currently selected patch stand out better in the colour grid - using white background and black font now.</li>
<li>#461 Alt-Tabbing away did lose current edit of the tree control. This is complex, trying a better handler for now only for the inline editing in the tree control.
You can tab away and back again and the current editor should still be active.</li>
