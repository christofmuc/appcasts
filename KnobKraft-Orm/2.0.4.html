<h2>New features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>#250, fixed Python version detection for the build system. Many thanks to @jpursey!</li>

</ul>
<h2>Synths:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Groove Synthesis 3rd Wave</strong> added, given they provide excellent documentation there is a good change that it works out of the box. If not, let me know!  </li>

<h2>Bug fixes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>#252 Fixed Virus bank management bug, many thanks to @nezetic for this!</li>
