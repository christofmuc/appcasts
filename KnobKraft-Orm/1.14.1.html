  <h2>Release 1.14.1</h2>

  This is a hotfix of the 1.14.0 release. The 1.14.0 suffered from two problems:

<ul>
<li>The software crashed when not a single synth had been configured before. This caused first time users to bail out and have to use an older version than 1.14.0 to get started.
</li>
<li> The Python version required was still stuck at 3.8. I updated this to 3.10. This should make no difference for Windows users, as the Python used is embedded in the installer, but for Mac users this *requires a Python upgrade*. This should be simpler than installing a Python 3.8, of which there are no Mac binary installers hosted anymore - just head over to https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/ and grab the latest 3.10 installer.<h3>
