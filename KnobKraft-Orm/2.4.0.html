<h2>New features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>#334 <strong>Auto fill new lists and banks</strong>: When creating a list or a new user bank, you know have the option to autofill the list
with patches from the currently selected search. E.g. you can easily make a list of your current favorite OB-6 basses by
setting up a filter and then clicking "add new list" and select auto fill with top hits. Or you can create a new user bank
with a random selection of all patches marked as "Lead", and subsequently send this into the synth.</li>
<li>The selected <strong>send mode is now persisted</strong> across program runs, and specific for each synth. So you can e.g. select
edit buffer to always get the correct patch when sending to a synth with small edit buffers, and automatic to prefer program 
change messages for slow synths like the Hydrasynth. If you always only want to send program change, select that send mode and 
make sure the synths of the banks are imported so KnobKraft knows which patch is where in the synth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Synths:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yamaha reface DX</strong> #324 had indicated a potential wrong impementation of the checksum, which did not seem to be effective but 
I changed the implementation anyway. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug fixes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>#333 was a bug that was preventing the program change send mode to work properly with the reface DX and other synths.</li>
<li>Fixed crash on exit which happened sometimes when MIDI messages were still being received duing shutdown.</li>
</ul>
