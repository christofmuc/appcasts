<h2>New features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a new menu entry into the edit menu to copy the names of the patches of the current bank into the clipboard. This
is useful to export bank's patch lists for other SW programs like Logic.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Synths:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Novation AStation</strong> - AStation and KStation could work with this adaptation, thanks to @thechildofroth for the initial version!</li>
<li><strong>Waldorf MicroWave 1</strong> - this is in beta state. Sending patches works, beware of MIDI loops created by the synth, you want you MIDI filtering to be properly setup. Thanks to Gerome for testing this! </li>
<li><strong>Yamaha TX7</strong> this is an adaptation close to the already existing DX-7 adaptation, but allows for proper two way communication. Thanks to Gerome for testing this for us!</li>
<li><strong>Sequential Take 5</strong> adaptation was updated for the new OS 2.0 which features double the amount of banks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug fixes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>#225 Fixing UI inconsistencies caused by the bank list sharing patches with other parts of the display. Going back to a low tech solution that works</li>
<li>#275 Little problems with the create new adaptation dialog</li>
<li>#272 Added instructions on how to build on Mac with installing ICU4C</li>
<li>#266 Added documentation and the requirements.txt file needed for structured adaptation testing </li>
